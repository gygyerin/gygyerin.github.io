  <p>
    Hi! My name is Yerin Choe, and I am a first-year PhD student at The University of Texas at Austin, focusing on water treatment technologies for safe and sustainable environmental systems. My research interests include advanced reductive processes, electrochemical defluorination of PFAS, non-noble metal catalysts, combined and scalable process design.
  </p>
  <p>
    I previously earned my M.S. in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Seoul National University, where my work in the Sustainable Environmental Technology Lab centered on PFAS degradation via UV/sulfite process for post-sorption treatment. I was also involved in developing analytical methods and studying sorption for PFAS. As an intern in the Metabolism-Carbon Modeling Group, I conducted nitrogen mass flow analysis in South Korea's food sector. My undergraduate research in  organic synthesis and organometallic catalyst provided a strong foundation for my academic journey.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am deeply interested in developing innovative degradation processes and uncovering mechanisms through rigorous scientific investigation to advance sustainability and environmental engineering research. I'm always open to conversations about the environment, PFOA, technologies, and PhD life. Thank you for connecting with me!
  </p>
