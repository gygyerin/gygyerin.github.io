<h3>Welcome!</h3>

<!-- I received M.S. in Civil and Environmental Engineering and B.S. in Chemistry from Seoul National University. -->

I am a first-year PhD student in Environmental and Water Resources Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, advised by Prof. Charles Werth. Before joining UT, I completed a B.S. in Chemistry and an M.S. in Civil & Environmental Engineering at Seoul National University.

My research focuses on physicochemical water treatment â€” advanced reductive processes, electrocatalysis, and sustainable, scalable process design.
