  I am a Research Assistant at the Sustainable Environmental Technologies Lab in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Seoul National University. With a background in chemistry and environmental engineering, I am deeply interested in advancing water treatment technologies and conducting environmental impact analyses to support informed decision-making. For more details, please see the sections below or visit my CV page.
  Areas of Focus:
  • Water treatment: physico-chemical water treatment, water-energy-environment nexus, water reuse, resource recovery, photochemical degradation, organic micropollutants, byproduct formation, sustainable process design, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
  • Environmental impact analysis: Life-cycle assessment (LCA) of products and emerging technologies, macroscopic-scale material flow analysis (MFA), energy model, decarbonization, water-energy-environment nexus, framework development incorporating artificial intelligence (AI)
